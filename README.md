# Baryon ESPer
### A PSP Baryon Sweeper port for ESP32 — easier, more accessible PSP unbricking
*Original Baryon Sweeper by khubik2 — ESP32 port guide*

> **Fork note (PSP-1000 / ESP32-C3):** this fork fixes battery authentication for
> PSP-1000 syscons (key versions `0x00`–`0x06`), replaces the diode with an
> open-drain TX, and reworks reply timing. See
> [docs/PSP-1001-debugging.md](docs/PSP-1001-debugging.md) for what was found,
> how, and what is still open.

## What is this?

Baryon ESPer lets you use a cheap ESP32 microcontroller to replicate the PSP Baryon Sweeper tool, which puts a PSP into **Service Mode** — the first step to recovering a bricked console.

## What you'll need

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| ESP32 board + USB cable | Any model should work |
| Working PSP battery | Must hold a charge |
| Breadboard + jumper wires | Or soldering setup if you prefer |
| Computer with Arduino IDE | Free download at arduino.cc |
| 10kΩ resistor | |
| Diode | Any standard signal diode with an orange band and black band (e.g. 1N4148) |
| Magic Memory Stick | **Not covered in this guide** — recommended tool: DC-ARK4 |

> ⚠️ **The Magic Memory Stick is required to actually unbrick your PSP.** This guide only covers getting into Service Mode. Prepare your Magic Memory Stick separately before proceeding.

## Step 1 — Wiring the circuit

The goal of this step is to build the following circuit:

### Wiring steps

1. **Prepare four wires on the ESP32**, connected to:
   - `GND`
   - `3.3V`
   - `Pin 4`
   - `Pin 5`

2. **Add the pull-up resistor and diode:**
   - Bridge `Pin 5` to `3.3V` using the **10kΩ resistor**
   - Connect the **anode** (orange band side) of the diode to `Pin 5`
   - Connect the **cathode** (black band side) of the diode to `Pin 4`

3. **Make the PSP battery terminal connector:**
   Connect `Pin 5` to the **middle pin** of the PSP's battery terminal.

   > 💡 **Tip:** It helps to make a 3-pin connector by sticking three wires into a small piece of wood or plastic (as shown in the picture below) so they stay evenly spaced and can plug into the PSP terminal cleanly. Connect the middle pin to the ESP's `Pin 5`.

4. **Connect the battery positive (`+`):**
   Connect the **right pin** of the PSP's battery terminal to the **`+` terminal of your PSP battery**.

   > 💡 **Tip:** It's recommended to make a separate 2-pin connector for the battery side, and a 3-pin connector for the PSP side.

5. **Connect ground:**
   Link the ESP32's `GND` to **both**:
   - The **left pin** of the PSP's battery terminal
   - The **`−` terminal** of your PSP battery

> ⚠️ **Double-check polarity before connecting the battery.** Reversed polarity can damage your PSP or ESP32.

## Step 2 — Flashing the ESP32

1. **Download** the `esper.ino` file from this GitHub repository.

2. **Open Arduino IDE**, create a new sketch, and paste the contents of `esper.ino` into it.

3. **Select your board and port:**
   - In the Board Manager, install **ESP32 by Espressif Systems** if you haven't already.
   - Select your ESP32 model and the correct COM port (Arduino IDE usually detects it automatically).

   > 💡 You may need to install additional drivers (e.g. CP210x or CH340) depending on your ESP32 model.

4. **Enable USB CDC on Boot:**
   Go to `Tools` → `USB CDC On Boot` → `Enabled`

5. **Upload the sketch:**
   Click the upload button and wait for Arduino IDE to compile and flash.

   > 💡 You can also edit the `TX` and `RX` pin numbers in the code to match your own wiring — just make sure the pins you choose are not already used by your ESP32 model.

6. **Done!** Your Baryon ESPer is ready. You can open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE to watch the output (availability depends on your ESP32 model, but it's not required).

## Step 3 — Entering Service Mode

> ⚠️ Follow these steps in order. Connecting things in the wrong sequence can cause issues.

1. **Power the ESP32** via its USB port (connect it to your PC or a USB wall adapter).
   You should see a **red LED** on the ESP32. If it's off, the board isn't getting power — check your USB connection.

2. **Connect your battery connector** to the PSP battery.
   Make sure the polarity is correct! Standard Dupont connectors can be pushed directly into the battery terminal if they fit.

3. **On the PSP:**
   - Plug in the **DC power cable**
   - Insert your **Magic Memory Stick**

4. **Connect the 3-pin PSP terminal connector.**
   Push it firmly into the PSP's battery terminal and make sure it holds well.

5. **Wait 1–3 seconds.** The PSP should boot into **Service Mode**.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Try this |
|---|---|
| PSP doesn't enter Service Mode | Check all connections, especially the 3-pin terminal |
| Still not working | In the code, change `SERIAL_8E1` to `SERIAL_8E2` in the `Serial1.begin(...)` line — ESP32s can be picky about serial modes |

```cpp
// Change this:
Serial1.begin(19200, SERIAL_8E1, PSP_RX_PIN, PSP_TX_PIN);

// To this:
Serial1.begin(19200, SERIAL_8E2, PSP_RX_PIN, PSP_TX_PIN);
```
